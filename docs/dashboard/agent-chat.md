# Agent chat (Dashboard)

The Dashboard gives you two ways to talk to an agent in a full-page chat: **Agents** (per-agent workspace) and **Project chats** (workspace tied to a project). Both use the same chat UI; the difference is how you arrive, how sessions are listed, and how new sessions are associated with a project.

## Open Agents chat

1. In the sidebar, choose **Agents** (support-agent icon).
2. Select an agent from the list.
3. Open the **Chat** tab.

You can also land on a specific session if the URL includes the chat tab and session id (for example `/agents/<agentId>/chat` with session state restored from navigation).

**What you see in the session list:** Sessions for that agent that are normal user chats. Task-linked threads can appear under a **Tasks** section in the sidebar when applicable; internal comment sessions are not mixed into the main list.

## Open Project chats

1. In the sidebar, use the **Project chats** rail (under the main nav when projects exist). Each chip is a project—click one to open project chat for that project.
2. The page shows the project name and an **Agent** field. Search or pick an agent; the chat loads once an agent is selected.

If no project is selected yet, choose a project from the rail first. If the rail is empty, add or load projects from **Projects** as usual.

**URL shape (deep links):** `/chats/<projectId>` and, once you pick an agent or session, `/chats/<projectId>/<agentId>` and optionally `/chats/<projectId>/<agentId>/<sessionId>`. The address updates when you change the active session so you can bookmark or share a link.

While you are on Project chats, no main sidebar tab is marked active (so **Projects** does not look selected); the **Project chats** rail shows which project you are in.

## Session list: Agents vs Project chats

| | **Agents chat** | **Project chats** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | All eligible sessions for the agent | Only sessions **for the selected project** |
| How scope is enforced | Listed from the agent | Sessions are requested with the project id; the UI also ignores updates for other projects so the list stays accurate when streams fire |
| Empty list | Generic “no sessions yet” guidance | Message tailored to having no sessions **for this project yet** |

New sessions created in Project chats **store the project** on the session so they stay in that project’s list.

## Starting and resetting sessions

- **New session** (toolbar plus in the session sidebar): Creates a session quickly. It does **not** wait on a memory checkpoint from the previous session.
- **`/new` or `/clear`** in the composer: Same as starting fresh, but uses the **checkpoint** flow tied to the current session when applicable (pair with “new session” behavior you expect from the CLI-style commands).

Project id is sent when creating a session from Project chats so the thread stays scoped.

## Header actions (Share, Debug, Delete)

- **Share** and **Debug** stay visible in the header for a consistent layout. Until you **select or create a session**, they are **disabled** (tooltips explain that you need a session). After a session is active, use **Share** for actions such as copying the session file path or downloading the session, and **Debug** for session-scoped debugging tools.
- **Delete** is always shown; it is disabled when there is no active session or while sending is in progress.
